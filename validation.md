To validate the system, several steps will be taken to ensure that it met the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.  

**Firstly,** a series of functional and non-functional tests were conducted by the development team to verify that the system was working as expected. These tests included unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.  

**Secondly,** a group of beta users were selected to test the system in a real-world environment and provide feedback on their experience. The feedback was collected through surveys and interviews and was used to identify areas for improvement.  

**Lastly,** the system was reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure that it met their expectations and requirements. The stakeholders were asked to provide feedback on the system's usability, functionality, and overall performance.  

Through these validation steps, the system will be successfully verified to meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
