## Product Backlog

To gather User Stories and their priorities, we used the technique of interviewing stakeholders.
This consisted of talking to people who have some relation to the product or service, such as customers,
tattoo artists, studio managers, among others, in order to understand their needs and expectations. 
This information was then transformed into User Stories, which are short and objective descriptions of the 
functionalities that the system must have to meet the users' needs.
